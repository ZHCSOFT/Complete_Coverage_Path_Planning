# path_eps_px
#   [pixel] distance between two points when generating the (line) path
#   where one pixel is the size of one cell in the navigation grid map
# double
path_eps_px: 6.0

# min_cell_area_px
#   parameters specific for the boustrophedon explorator
#   [pixel^2] min area a boustrophedon cell (i.e. a boustrophedon region of the map) must have to be determined for the path generation
# double
min_cell_area_px: 200.0

# max_deviation_from_track_px
#   [pixel] maximal allowed shift off the ideal boustrophedon track to both sides for avoiding obstacles on track
#   setting max_deviation_from_track=grid_spacing is usually a good choice
#   for negative values (e.g. max_deviation_from_track: -1) max_deviation_from_track is automatically set to grid_spacing
# int
